                <h1>Taxes Definition: Types, who Pays and why?</h1>
                <br>
                <P>Taxes are mandantory contributions levied on individuals or corporations by a government
                    entity-whether local,
                    regional,or nation.<strong>Tax revenues</strong> financial government activities,including public
                    works and
                    services such as roads and schools, or programs such Social Security and Medicare.
                    Taxes also play a pivotal role in shaping the economic landscape of any country, and Kenya is no
                    exception. As a developing nation with aspirations of achieving sustained economic growth and
                    improved social welfare, understanding the intricate web of taxation is crucial.</p>
                <br>
                <p>From the revenue generated to fund public services and infrastructure development to the
                    redistribution of wealth and
                    promotion of economic stability, taxes are the backbone of a nation's financial ecosystem.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Please keep in mind that tax laws and regulations can change, and specific circumstances can vary, so
                    it's important to refer to the most recent and accurate sources for information regarding taxes and
                    deductions in Kenya. If you're an employee, your employer's payroll department or a tax professional
                    should be able to provide you with precise details about the taxes and deductions that apply to your
                    situation.</p>
